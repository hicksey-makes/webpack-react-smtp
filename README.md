single page application for showing parts

I am creating a single page application whereby I will fetch data from a server and show a page based upon the part data received from the server. 
It is a single page app, built with react and utilizing webpack.
Bootstrap is used to make it responsive. \n
**A reusable UI for parts received from a server**
