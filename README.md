# webpack-react-showmetheparts
single page application for showing parts.
Hypothetical job description whereby I create a reusable, responsive UI/webpage for showing a part's details.

I am creating a single page application where I will fetch data from a server and fill page details based upon the part data received from the server. 
It is a single page app, built with react and utilizing webpack.
Bootstrap is used to make it responsive.  

**A reusable UI for parts received from a server**
